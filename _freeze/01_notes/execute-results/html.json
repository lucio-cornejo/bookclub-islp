It makes connections between the fields of statistics, linear algebra and functional analysis. \n\nIn particular, the **Statistical learning theory** deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data and this is what is best known as **supervised learning**, in this book we will see more than just theory, as we will deal with **unsupervised learning** as well as making practical applications.\n\n\n- **Supervised:** \"Building a model to **predict an *output* from *inputs*.**\"\n  - Predict `wage` from `age`, `education`, and `year`.\n  - Predict `market direction` from `previous days' performance`.\n- **Unsupervised:** Inputs but no specific outputs, **find relationships and structure.**\n  - Identify `clusters` within `cancer cell lines`.\n\n\n## Why ISLP?\n\n- \"Facilitate the transition of statistical learning from an academic to a mainstream field.\"\n- Machine learning* is useful to everyone, let's all learn enough to use it responsibly.\n- Python \"labs\" make this make sense for this community!\n\n## Premises of ISLP\n\nFrom Page 9 of the Introduction:\n\n- \"Many statistical learning methods are relevant and useful in a wide range of academic and non-academic disciplines, beyond just the statistical sciences.\"\n- \"Statistical learning should not be viewed as a series of black boxes.\"\n- \"While it is important to know what job is performed by each cog, it is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the box!\"\n- \"We presume that the reader is interested in applying statistical learning methods to real-world problems.\"\n\n## Notation\n\n- *n* = number of observations (rows)\n- *p* = number of features/variables (columns)\n- We'll come back here if we need to as we go!\n- Some symbols they assume we know:\n  - $\\in$ = \"is an element of\", \"in\"\n  - ${\\rm I\\!R}$ = \"real numbers\"\n\n## What have we gotten ourselves into?\n\n**An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshiraniis)**, is a collection of modern statistical methods for modeling and making predictions from real-world data.\n\nIt is a middle way between theoretical statistics and the practice of applying statistics to real-world problems.\n\nIt can be considered as a user manual, with self-contained Python labs, which lead you through the use of different methods for applying statistical analysis to different kinds of data.\n\n- 2: Terminology & main concepts\n- 3-4: Classic linear methods\n- 5: Resampling (so we can choose the best method)\n- 6: Modern updates to linear methods\n- 7+: Beyond Linearity (we can worry about details as we get there)\n\n## Where's the data?\n\n```python\npip install ISLP\n```\n\nWe'll look at this data in more detail below.\n\n## Some useful resources:\n\n- the book page: [statlearning.com](https://www.statlearning.com/)\n- pdf of the book: [ISLRv2_website](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf)\n- ISLP [labs](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/tree/v2)\n- course on edX: [statistical-learning](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning)\n- youtube channel: [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/playlists)\n- exercise solutions: [applied solutions](https://botlnec.github.io/islp/)\n\n**Some more theoretical resources:**\n\n- The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL, by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman) [ESLII](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)\n\n\n## What is covered in the book?\n\nThe book provides a series of toolkits classified as **supervised or unsupervised** techniques for understanding data.\n\nThe second edition of the book (2021) contains additions within the most updated statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Editions](images/01-contents.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## How is the book divided?\n\nThe book is divided into 13 chapters covering:\n\n- Introduction and Statistical Learning:\n  - Supervised Versus Unsupervised Learning\n  - Regression Versus Classification Problems\n\n**Linear statistical learning**\n\n- Linear Regression:\n  - basic concepts\n  - introduction of K-nearest neighbor classifier\n      \n- Classification:\n  - logistic regression\n  - linear discriminant analysis\n\n- Resampling Methods:\n  - cross-validation\n  - the bootstrap\n    \n- Linear Model Selection and Regularization: \npotential improvements over standard linear regression\n  - stepwise selection\n  - ridge regression\n  - principal components regression\n  - the lasso\n\n**Non-linear statistical learning**\n\n- Moving Beyond Linearity:\n  - Polynomial Regression\n  - Regression Spline\n  - Smoothing Splines\n  - Local Regression\n  - Generalized Additive Models\n    \n- Tree-Based Methods:\n  - Decision Trees\n  - Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting, and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees\n    \n- Support Vector Machines (linear and non-linear classification)\n\n- Deep Learning (non-linear regression and classification)\n\n- Survival Analysis and Censored Data\n\n- Unsupervised Learning:\n  - Principal components analysis\n  - K-means clustering\n  - Hierarchical clustering\n    \n- Multiple Testing\n\n\n**Each chapter includes 1 self-contained R lab on the topic**\n\n## Some examples of the problems addressed with statistical analysis\n\n- Identify the risk factors for some type of cancers\n- Predict whether someone will have a hearth attack on the basis of demographic, diet, and clinical measurements\n- Email spam detection\n- Classify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes, based on a gene expression profile\n- Establish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey data\n\n([source](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/Slides/Ch1_Inroduction.pdf))\n\n\n## Datasets provided in the ISLP package\n\nThe book provides the ISLP Python package with all the datasets needed the analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Datasets in ISLP package](images/01-datasets.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",
